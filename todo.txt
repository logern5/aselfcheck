//Find a way to transfer information about purchase from scheck.html to checkout.html (environment variable, cookies?) (DONE)
//Add transaction recording/final checkout

Transaction recording and final checkout works now. All that's left is css on the thank you page, main page, and checkout page to match the other pages, maybe matching
background color and some text centering on the title and checkout pages. Also, removing commented out code and debug lines.
